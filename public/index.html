                    <p id="homemsg">The app for the aspiring fitness buff or serious athlete. The Workout App was built for those who want to exercise with purpose while also living a time constrained lifestyle. Not everyone has the money for a personal trainer and not every personal trainer is willing to adapt to the needs and complexities of fine tuning a specific program based on specific criterion. While some people may have their own priceless knowledge of purpose specific programming, in todayâ€™s fast-paced society it can be difficult to find time to program muscle confusing effective workouts day after day.</p>

                    <p>This is where The Workout App can help!  The Workout App was created to provide any motivated individual a randomized set of exercises based on their specific needs for that day with just a few touches of the screen. A user can pick how long they would like their session to last, what their specific purpose for exercising is, what muscle group(s) they would like to target, and what equipment they have available at the time. No equipment at the time? No problem.  The Workout App has a lengthy set of effective body weight exercises for all levels of athleticism.  The Workout App will also provide the user with recommended weight for each exercise based on some quick, and simple input. Say goodbye to the same old boring workout that is sure to put you in a rut. Say hello to  The Workout App!</p>
